It's been a while since I've worked with OpenGL, but it was something I really enjoyed in my coursework. 
Eventually I would like to get into VR, realtime physics simulations and/or AI. 
My class primarily focused on WebGL, so I figure it's time to dive into the less abstracted "real" stuff. 

Most of these concepts are familiar to me, but I'm taking my time and trying to get a deep understanding
of how the backend of this API works. I may need to brush up on my linear algebra.
